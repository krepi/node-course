# ObjectsLib

## Overview

ObjectsLib is a versatile JavaScript library designed for advanced object manipulation. It offers a range of functionalities including creating immutable objects, observing changes, deep cloning, and validating properties according to a schema. This library is ideal for developers looking to extend the standard object manipulation capabilities in JavaScript.

## Installation

To integrate ObjectsLib into your project, you can use either CommonJS or ES6 module imports. Ensure that you have the `ObjectsLib.js` file in your project directory.

### Using CommonJS Modules

```javascript
const ObjectsLib = require("./ObjectsLib.js");
```

### Using ES6 Modules

```javascript
import ObjectsLib from "./ObjectsLib.js";
```

## Features

### Task 1: Object Property Manipulation

- Manipulate properties of an object to make them read-only.
- Add non-enumerable and non-configurable properties.
- Implement a method to update object properties within the constraints of read-only descriptors.

### Task 2: Object Property Enumeration and Deletion

- Adjust object properties to be non-enumerable and non-writable.
- Calculate values using non-enumerable properties.
- Delete properties safely, throwing errors when trying to delete non-configurable properties.

### Task 3: Object Property Getters and Setters

- Utilize getters and setters to manage object properties dynamically.
- Implement method to transfer values between objects while automatically updating related properties.

### Task 4: Advanced Property Descriptors

- Create deep, immutable copies of objects, handling nested objects and arrays.

### Task 5: Object Observation

- Return a proxy object that logs access and modifications to properties.

### Task 6: Object Deep Cloning

- Deep clone objects to create independent copies, handling circular references and complex nested structures.

### Task 7: Object Property Validation

- Validate an object against a specified schema to ensure it meets all required criteria including property types and structures.
